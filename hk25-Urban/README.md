# Urban (hk25-Urban)

Current km-scale resolutions open new opportunities to study new aspects of the climate that previously where out of scope. Among these, urban environtments start to be identified as areas with a significant amount of grid points. 

More than half of the global population currently lives in urban environtments, how global km-scale models represent these areas is a new topic that requires new paradigms of analyses and experteses. Now is the moment, to incorporate urban specialist from other areas (e.g. regional climate modellers, urban modellers) to start to analyze the urban related dynamics in the global km-scale models.

In this team, we aim to identify how global km-scale models represent urban dynamics (e.g. heat island, local circulation impacts, ...)

**Coordination**: Llu√≠s Fita (lluis.fita@cima.fcen.uba.ar)

Sketch of initial activities:
+ Identify main urban environtments in global km-scale models
+ Quantify urban impact in the surroundings (e.g. heat island)
+ Analyze where and how global km-scale models compared to on-purpose urban modelling initiatives at smaller spatial scales
