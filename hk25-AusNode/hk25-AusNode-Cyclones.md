# Chasing Cyclones (hk25-Cyclones)

### Project Details

#### Project Lead: Chris A

#### Project members: Michael B, Chenhui Jin (remote)

#### Number of open slots for students:

#### Expertise needed:

none

### Project Description

#### Background:

Tropical cyclones are the most dramatic manifestation of deep convection in the atmosphere. Does high resolution improve the representation of tropical cyclones?  What changes when we increase the resolution?  To analyse cyclones in the model, firstly we have to locate them and track them as they move and evolve.

#### Primary research question:

How do basic metrics of tropical cyclone intensity (eg geometry, pressure, winds, rain distribution) in the high resolution simulations compare to what we see in reanalysis products? 

#### Secondary research questions:

How does the spectrum of tropical cyclones produced in the simulations compare with those that actually occurred in the simulated year?

#### Primary output:

Survey of tropical cyclone metrics (?) in the simulations.  

### Methodology

#### Datasets: 

pressure, winds, humidity, precip at surface (and other levels?)  
SST and/or surface heat/water fluxes  
ERA5 ditto (should be available already on gadi)


#### Methods:

Use Chenhuiâ€™s TempestExtremes jupyter notebooks to track and composite individual T/Cs.  Will be confirmed that the package is accessible and works for the  Students can concentrate on individual events and/or metrics, and then combine findings at end.
