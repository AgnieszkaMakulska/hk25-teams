# Model intercomparison for extremes precipitation (hk25-ExtP)

### Project Details

This project intercompares multiple model output including Narclim and the global convection permitting models, and others that will be available

Simulated precipitation will be compared against station data at different temporal scales (hourly, daily, monthly) and regions of interest (e.g., Sydney, Suva (Fiji))

The teams will perform analysis around seasonal and diurnal cycles of extreme precipitation.

#### Project Lead: Ashneel Chandra (ashneel.chandra@unimelb.edu.au) and Leena Khadke (l.khadke@unsw.edu.au)

#### Project members:

#### Number of open slots for students: 1-2 groups (4-5 participants per group)

 

#### Expertise needed:

Basic statistics in Python

### Project Description

#### Background:

The project aims to explore how will do both convection permitting and non-convection permitting models capture observed extreme precipitation. The participants will use a range of metrics to perform this evaluation.

#### Primary research question:

How well do convection-permitting models represent extreme precipitation compared to non-convection-permitting models?

#### Secondary research questions:

Additional research questions that may be answered along the way, or as an extension. These can be bigger questions and could be less concrete

#### Primary output:

A comparison of different model simulations to observed precipitation

#### Secondary outputs:

Figures and scripts

### Methodology

Statistical analysis including quantile mapping, pdfs applied to seasonal cycles, daily and monthly precipitation time series from stations and models

#### Datasets:

Precipitation model simulations

Station data (Sydney archive and Fiji archive) will be provided by the leaders

Potentially BARRA-R2 (available on Gadi)

 

#### Methods:

It would be very helpful if the CMS team could provide examples of Jupyter notebooks that show how we can regrid from HEALPix into regular grid or data loading and common post-processing
