# Australia node: research topics (hk25-AusNode)

The Australian node has ten research topics that all leverage kilometer-scale (km-scale) global simulations to address a wide range of atmospheric and climate science questions. From local phenomena like urban circulation and coastal winds to large-scale features such as tropical convergence zones and convectively-coupled systems, each topic explores how high-resolution models can advance our understanding of weather and climate across scales. Our goal is to analyze global simulations through a local lens, using existing tools, methodologies, and datasets.

**Note:** We actively invite collaboration with science teams working in related topics.

**Topics:**

* [Towards enhancing climate projections through improved understanding and simulations of marine low clouds](/hk25-AusNode/hk25-AusNode-LowClouds.md)
* [Evaluation of Meso-scale Degree of Organization of Convection](/hk25-AusNode/hk25-AusNode-DOCmeso.md)
* [Chasing Cyclones](/hk25-AusNode/hk25-AusNode-Cyclones.md)
* [Model intercomparison for extremes precipitation](/hk25-AusNode/hk25-AusNode-ExtP.md)
