## STORMS under Climate Change (hk25-STORMCC)

High-resolution climate models and atmospheric reanalysis datasets now provide detailed and frequently updated wind fields, offering new opportunities to study wind climatology and its impact on aerosol distribution. These data enable investigations across global and regional domains, as well as across different seasons and times of day. sFor the hackathon, our team will explore how well climate models reproduce key wind features and their role in dust uplift, using both model outputs and benchmark datasets like ERA5 and CMIP6.

### We aim to:
- Identify wind climatology patterns from kilometer-scale climate model outputs over global and regional domains.
- Assess dust uplift potential based on surface wind characteristics.
- Analyze the diurnal cycle of wind patterns over Northern Africa, a key region for dust emissions.
- Compare model results with established datasets such as ERA5 and CMIP6 to evaluate performance and consistency.
